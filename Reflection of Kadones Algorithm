1.Kadones algorithm finds the sum of largest sub array 
2.two variables are maintained one with temp and other is max
3.we add element to temp each time if it is less than 0 then we make temp as 0
4.and if max is lass than temp then make temp as max
5.step 3 and 4 are repeated n number of times 
6.max value is returned
